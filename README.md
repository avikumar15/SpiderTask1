Gravity Stones.

Task details -

Now that Thor is fit and fine, the Avengers are back at it with renewed vigor. But Thanos has another trick up his sleeve. His children Móði and Magni can now control gravity!
This makes the other infinity stones go up and down. We want you to replicate this behaviour of changing gravity by tapping on the screen. That is, every time that Thanos taps the screen the gravity reverses. Implement this feature for one circle.
Hackermode : Randomly generate 5 infinity stones and control their gravity.

Here, I submit the hackermode app.
